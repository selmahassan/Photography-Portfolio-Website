        <h2>Photographer Based in New York City</h2>
        <p>Selma's photography is centered around things in her life. Being Sudanese-American, she brings a new and fresh perspective to photography. 
            Selma's ultimate goal is to provide a unique perspective and provide a voice for other Sudanis and Muslims around the world.
